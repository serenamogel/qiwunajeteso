However, after completing&nbsp;Project Runway&nbsp;Sebelia separated from his girlfriend.&nbsp;It was Harrison, Sebelia’s son, who inspired his trademark neck tattoo which took more than eight hours to complete. The tattoo reads&nbsp;“Harrison Detroit l’amor de la mia vita.”&nbsp;It is his son’s name, along with the phrase “the love of my life,” in Italian. But the tattoo contains a mistake; the correct diction is “l’amore della mia vita”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeffrey-sebelia-project-runway-clothing-line></span>Jeffrey Sebelia Project Runway ( Clothing Line )<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2006, he auditioned for a spot in the Bravo series ‘Project Runway’ after seeing his friend, Santino Rice, succeed.
