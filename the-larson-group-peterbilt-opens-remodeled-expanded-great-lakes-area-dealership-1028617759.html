The <span class=xn-location>Portage, Indiana</span>-based dealership was acquired by TLG in 2014 and has spent the last several months upgrading its facilities and offerings.</p><p>The Peterbilt dealership received a fresh coat of paint and made other exterior upgrades for its grand re-opening, but those improvements are just a small portion of the extensive additions and upgrades TLG has made to the facility over the summer.</p><p>"As our dealership and customer base continues to grow, so does the amount of equipment we need to service," said General Manager <span class=xn-person>Brett Myers</span>. "Our team is anxious to provide a wider array of services, improve efficiency and minimize downtime."</p><p>More Space and Amenities to Meet the TLG Gold Standard</p><p>In addition to cosmetic improvements to its exterior, the Peterbilt service dealership's renovation by Built By Chester, Inc. included eight new 40-by-150-foot service bays for a total of 24 bays, including one wash bay and one steam bay. In total, the upgraded dealership received 6,000 square feet of additional space. The location also has ISO-calibrated tool storage, which ensures all tools used to measure product quality at the dealership meet industry standards for excellence.</p><p>Myers said, "The space gives us more flexibility and opportunity for our employees to be even more ambitious toward being the best of the best."</p><p>TLG Vice President <span class=xn-person>Mike Thurston</span> added, "Our service bays were at full capacity and our number one priority has been and will always be our customers.
