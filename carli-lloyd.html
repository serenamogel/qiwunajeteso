The captain for the US Women Soccer team is currently enjoying her career playing for <i>Sky Blue</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not just that, recently, Llyod said that she is serious about starting the kicking career in <i>NFL</i> too. Apart from her playing career, Lloyd is enjoying her family time with her husband of three years. Who is she married to? Let's know more about her relationship status.</p><h2>Is Carli Lloyd Married? Know Her Husband</h2><p>In case you don't follow women soccer; the National team captain is happily married. She tied the knot in 2016 with <a href=#><strong>Brian Hollins</strong></a><strong>,</strong> who is a pro golfer. After winning the world cup, the whole of the United States also celebrated its "Captain America's" engagement.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/20/Carli-Lloyd-and-Brian-Hollins-1024x656-1576821905247.jpg><p>&nbsp;According to The <i>Knot</i>, the couple is a high school sweetheart. After being in a relationship for so long, nuptial is just a formality for the lovely duo. The pair were together for fifteen years and are head over heels in love. In January 2015, Hollins popped up the big question with a cushion-cut halo and a triple shank diamond band.</p><p>They walked down the aisle on November 4, 2016, after the Rio Olympics. For the big day, the pair took a trip to Puerto Morelos, Mexico, in the company of their family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Carli Lloyd's Net Worth</h2><p>Most of her wealth comes from her brand endorsement rather than her salary. Lloyd's wealth is around <strong>$500,000</strong> as per online sources. Her income ranges from <strong>$10,000</strong> to <strong>$30,000</strong>.</p><p>After winning the world cup, the women's team, including Lloyd, received a sum of <strong>$2 million</strong> and a further <strong>$75,000</strong> bonus. Her fortune can be compared to another team-mate, <a href=#><strong>Adrianna Franch</strong></a><strong>,</strong> who receives a payout of <strong>$16,000</strong> to <strong>$45,000</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/20/Carli-Lloyd-2-1576822008192.jpg><p>In addition to her national team, she played in club football as well. Her brand endorsement adds more fortune to her assets. She had a deal with <i>Nike</i> for several years and also endorses for <i>Pressure Makes Us: Carli Lloyd</i>. Furthermore, she starred in the&nbsp;<i>Xfinity</i> commercial and also signed a contract with <i>Visa</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of her other brands are <i>Lifeway, Heineken, United Airlines, NJM Insurance</i>, and <i>Beats,</i> to name a few. Furthermore, she previously modeled for <i>Sports Illustrated, Glamour</i>, and <i>Shape magazine</i>. From her modeling and brand endorsements, her wealth might've increased ten folds.</p><h2>Lloyd thinking about NFL</h2><p>After completing the 2020 Olympics, Lloyd is seriously thinking about starting her <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>kicking career</strong></a> in NFL. In the radio interview, her kicking of the ball was not a publicity stunt and wants to think about her next move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/20/694940094001_6075197893001_6075198889001-vs-1576822138186.jpg><p>Another legendary NFL player, <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a><strong>,</strong> also weighed in on Lloyd, saying she has the potential of kicking field goals in <i>NFL</i>. So far, a couple of <i>NFL</i> teams have approached the World Cup winner, but she is currently focused on the Olympics in 2020.</p><h2>Her Early Life, Age, and Social Media</h2><p>Born on July 16, 1982, Lloyd is thirty-seven-years-old as of 2019. The 5 feet 7-inch tall Midfielder grew up alongside her siblings in Delran Township, New Jersey, USA.</p><p>Her father, <strong>Stephen Lloyd</strong> and Mother <strong>Pamela Lloyd</strong> raised her well and supported her soccer career from the early age of five.
