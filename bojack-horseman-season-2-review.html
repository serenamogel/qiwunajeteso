As part of that process, he starts a long-term relationship with Wanda (Lisa Kudrow), an owl and TV exec who’s just woken up from a 30-year coma. Kudrow’s a fantastic addition to the cast, even beyond the fact that Lisa Kudrow voicing an owl just makes perfect sense. The fourth episode, maybe the best non-drug-trip-related episode BoJack has done yet, involves Wanda telling a pair of shaggy dog jokes to BoJack, and the payoff gets its appropriately wise punch thanks to Kudrow.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>The rest of the gang is much the same as we left them last year. Maybe the biggest sign of growth for the show is how often it can now operate independent of BoJack. Todd (Aaron Paul) has so reliably become a facilitator of random hijinks that an entire subplot is spent comparing him to Steve Urkel, but BoJack’s at its best when silliness and character stories strike a balance.</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=true>Again, the fourth episode provides a great showcase for BoJack’s split personality. In one plot, Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter (a treasure of a character and performance from Paul F. Tompkins) are nervously evaluating how their recent marriage has and hasn’t changed them. In another, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) is entertaining her boyfriend, Vincent Adultman, and his son, Kevin, a matter complicated by the fact that Vincent is almost certainly three boys stacked on top of one another in a trench coat, Little Rascals-style.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Between the two stories, you’ve got a perfect example of how Bob-Waksberg’s understanding of TV conventions allows BoJack to expertly ape sitcom structure, while telling messy stories about people who don’t always wind up the same person they were at the start of the episode. Clichés exist for a reason, in TV and life, and much of the dramatic heft of BoJack comes from watching the characters navigate their way between the good ones and the bad.</p><p data-characters=702 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>As comedy, BoJack Horseman’s second season is rarely less than amusing, thanks to its colourful animation, huge stable of celebrity voice cameos, and bizarre taxonomic conceit. There’s really no good reason why the world of BoJack Horseman looks like a zoo, other than because animals are an inexhaustible source of jokes. The only weak episode of the first six sets out to explore some of that world’s internal logic, but even it gets great mileage out of a stupid runner about the various puns a chicken cluck can sound like. Whether providing scene-transitioning sight gags or subtle character commentary, the cross-species playfulness of the show more than justifies the inexplicable premise.</p><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=false>There’s a method to how BoJack Horseman uses its pop culture shorthand that often makes the rest of the humor more than just swings at easy TV targets and ‘90s nostalgia. BoJack Horseman might never be Netflix’s most important show, but in some ways it’s the most telling about the current state of TV. BoJack’s claim to fame, Horsin’ Around, was a riff on early ‘90s sitcoms like Full House, which, as it turns out, Netflix will be reviving. As <strong>BoJack Horseman</strong>&nbsp;astutely, hysterically reveals, mourning the past is often a lot healthier than trying to live in it.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Great</h5><p class=review-summary>Those hungry for more of BoJack Horseman's bittersweet laughs will devour Season 2 like BoJack tearing through a complimentary breadbasket.</p><p class=review-title>BoJack Horseman Season 2 Review</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yju8mamqRlmKS%2FtLHMmqVmq5WWwLC6jGtkq52mnrK4e5Fo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-deneuve.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Catherine Deneuve- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-walker-daughter-brothers-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Walker Wasn't Just a Star Actor, He Was a Fantastic Human Being</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
