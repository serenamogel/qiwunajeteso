They dress alike (both favor slinky dresses and oversize sunglasses), accompany each other to the bathroom and even measure out their food to make sure they consume exactly the same amount and therefore have identical figures. Oh, and they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have the same boyfriend</a> — 37-year-old electrician Ben.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Identical twins Anna and Lucy and their boyfriend, Ben.</figure><p>“We think of each other as one person,” Lucy told The Post. “We can never be apart.”</p><p>The twins, who refer to each other as “soulmates,” have been dating Ben for 10 years. They would marry him if they could, they said, but it’s against the law. The trio met virtually on Facebook through a mutual friend.</p><p>“The first night we met him, we both kissed him,” said Anna. “It was great from the start. We just hit it off straightaway. It’s so much easier for us to share a boyfriend. I don’t mind that he comes over to kiss Lucy, because then he’s going to kiss me. He treats us equally. He knows that whatever he does to one twin, he does to the other.”</p><p>Lucy said the twins have tried dating different people in the past, but it didn’t work out because “they wanted to separate us.”</p><p>“Ben understands our bond and doesn’t judge us,” she said. “That’s how it’s been from Day 1. There’s never been any jealousy. I don’t know how we had separate boyfriends. People can judge us how they like — this is how it works for us.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignleft size-large">Identical twins Anna and Lucy want to live life as “the same person” <span class=credit>Steph King</span></figure><p>The twins estimate that the most time they’ve ever spent apart was when they both got breast implant surgery. Lucy went first, so Anna had to wait by herself for “an hour,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“When she goes to the toilet, I come with her; when she has a shower, I come with her,” said Anna. “You name it and we do it. We’re never apart. I don’t think we’d function without each other. We have separation anxiety. We’re bound to each other.”</p><p>It hasn’t been an issue to get friends and family to support their unusual dynamic, they said. “If you don’t accept it, you won’t be in our life,” said Lucy. “Anyone that meets us just knows that we want to live life as one person. [We] get internet trolls and haters online. People can have their opinions — but at the end of the day, we’re not hurting anyone. I am proud of this beautiful relationship.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>They married twin brothers</strong></h2><p>Virginia twins Brittany and Briana Salyer, 34, are in a “quaternary marriage,” which is when two sets of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">identical twins</a> marry each other. Briana and Brittany are married to twins Jeremy and Josh, 37. Ever since they tied the knot in 2018, all four of them live together in the same house at a wedding event venue that they all run.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Briana (left) and Brittany Deane married fellow identical twins Jeremy (left) and Josh Salyers, and were pregnant at the same time, due weeks apart.</figure><p>Unlike Anna and Lucy, they stressed that they do not share bedroom activities.</p><p>“I’m married to only Josh,” said Brittany. “And Briana is married to only Jeremy. So it’s not that the four of us are married to each other.”</p><p>Nevertheless, they plan to raise their kids communally as four parents, rather than acting as aunts and uncles to each other’s children. Whether the kids will call them both “Mom” is an issue that will be explored in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“That is something that we are working out as far as what our children will call the two moms and the two dads,” said Brittany.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair met Jeremy and Josh at an annual <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">twins festival</a> in Twinsburg, Ohio. The women have attended it since 2011.</p><p>“The twin festival is not a romance thing, it’s a place where twins and multiples can meet other twins who understand the twin experience,” said Brittany. “We were always hoping in the back of our minds that maybe this is the place where we would meet our future husbands.”</p><p>Josh and Jeremy have a dynamic similar to Brittany and Briana — the men had even told their mom they would never marry unless they found identical twin women who were perfect for them, Brittany said.&nbsp;</p><p>“When we all four met, it was this instant connection. I paired off with Josh and Briana and Jeremy automatically paired off,” said Brittany. “So we never went through a situation where it was like, ‘Oh, which twin is going to be with which twin brother?’ ”</p><p>The women describe it as “love at first sight” and a “whirlwind romance.”</p><p>“We kind of knew growing up and as we were dating in our 20s that we would need to marry identical twin brothers who understood our bond,” said Briana. “We have dated singletons and twins in the past — it couldn’t just be any identical twin brothers, it had to be the right set. And so when we met Josh and Jeremy, we had been going to the twin festival for several years, and they were our perfect match.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignright size-large">Twin sisters Brittany and Briana are “Extreme Sisters” who married twin brothers <span class=credit>TLC</span></figure><p>Even though they consider their marriages separate, the women admit that “it works best when it’s the four of us” and they go on group dates.&nbsp;</p><p>“It has been a bit of a struggle figuring out some kind of separation,” said Briana. “And that’s something the show will illustrate. There was actually an epiphany we had while filming — we’ve never been on individual dates with our own husbands!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>They sleep in the same bed</strong></h2><p>Oklahoma duo Baylee Ring, 22, and Brooke Johnston, 24, share more than a profession. Brooke is a teacher while Baylee is in school to become one, and their first names are both technically Candace.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Sisters Brooke (left) and Baylee (right) <span class=credit>Brett Deering</span></figure><p>They are Candace Brooke and Candace Baylee (even though they call each other Brooke and Baylee). Brooke also named her 3-year-old daughter Candace Ace, even though they call her Ace. That tradition came from their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mom had always wanted to name her first daughter Candace because that’s her name,” said Baylee. “She named Brooke ‘Candace Brooke.’”&nbsp;</p><p>Their father got the name tattooed on his heart when Brooke was born, but when it was Baylee’s turn, “My mom said, ‘You’re not getting any more tattoos on your heart!’ ” Baylee said. “My dad thought I’d feel left out without my name on his chest.”</p><p>So her name became Candace, too, and the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I was pregnant with Ace, I was trying to think of a name that was meaningful and I couldn’t imagine not having her after my mom, my sister and me,” said Brooke. “So when Ace was born, I was like, ‘We have to name her Candace!’ ”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignleft size-large">Brooke (right) and Baylee are “Extreme Sisters” <span class=credit>Brett Deering</span></figure><p>Baylee is living with Brooke and her husband, Denver. As “Extreme Sisters” shows, Baylee often sneaks into Brooke’s bed at night, sliding in between Brooke and Denver — much to Denver’s dismay.</p><p>The activity is about sisterly closeness, both maintained. “I’m not trying to get with Denver,” said Baylee.</p><p>“The longest we’ve been apart was when I went to college, I stayed for a semester and I could not do it,” said Brooke.&nbsp;</p><p>Onscreen, the sisters are often shown popping each other’s pimples and picking food out of each other’s teeth. Brooke explains that when she was pregnant with Ace, Baylee shaved her private areas for her.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s not very many boundaries with your sister, at least in our family,” she said. “We’re just really intertwined in each other’s lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21ma21forKmwIytn55lpKGwbrHXramepZViwKq%2F056prGWnnbxuv8eaqZ5lkWKvsMXFq6CeppRirm6uxJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-vivek-ramaswamy-wife-apoorva-tewari-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Vivek Ramaswamy Wife, Apoorva Tewari?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-levis-age-instagram-wikipedia-domain-6-networth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Is Will Levis From The Kentucky Wildcats?
