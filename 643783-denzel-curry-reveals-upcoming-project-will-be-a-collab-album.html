Moreover, the Miami rapper addressed previous hints that his next album would be Designed By Angels. According to Curry, his next album will no longer be that, but rather a collaborative effort titled ULT Or Die. While he didn't say when or with who this album would be releasing, he did give fans a mission. After teasing them, he asked fans to bring his song <a href=# rel>"Walkin"</a> past 60 million streams on Spotify, and if they do, he'll spill the beans.</p><p>"AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW DESIGNED BY ANGELS WILL NOT BE THE NEXT ALBUM," he tweeted early Friday morning (March 10). "THE COLLAB TAPE WILL BE THE NEXT THING THAT DROPS BUT I DONT KNOW WHEN. IT MIGHT IN A YEAR IT MIGHT BE TONIGHT WHO KNOWS. ULT OR DIE COLLAB TAPE COMING SOON WITH… NONE OF YO GAWTDAMN BUSINESS. GET THIS PAST 60 MILLION AND<a href=# rel> ILL LET YOU HEAR WHAT IM WORKING ON.</a>"</p><span><h2 id=h-denzel-curry-teases-collab-album>Denzel Curry Teases Collab Album</h2></span><p>Of course, it's not like the "CLOUT COBAIN" MC has stayed completely silent since last year's excellent Melt My Eyez See Your <a href=# class=text-word rel>Future</a>. Not only did he release an expanded edition of the album with soulful and jazzy live instrumentation, but he's been on quite the feature run. His most recent venture was assisting midwxst's <a href=# rel>"Tally,"</a> which showed him on his typical cold, smooth flows. As one of the most consistently impressive artists working today, anything he drops is a treat for hip-hop fans.</p><p>Still, that doesn't mean that he should be complacent with the success and acclaim he's already experienced and received. Moreover,<a href=# rel> he expressed disappointment in the Grammy nominations in rap categories</a> this year. Not only did they miss out on his album, but also the greatness of JID, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Freddie Gibbs</a>, and many more. Even though the Recording Academy might not give these leaders their flowers, they're referred to as leaders for a reason.
