This results in a trampoline that is more expensive but performs better overall. The diameter of the spring coil may also have an impact on the quality of the spring stretch produced by the spring.</p><h3><span>Also, do you know whether there is a significant difference between a 14-foot and a 15-foot</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>trampoline?</span></h3><p>If you’re trying to decide between a 14-foot and a 15-foot trampoline, there are various factors to consider.
