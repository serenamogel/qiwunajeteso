In a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Harper's Bazaar U.K.</a>, Knightley, who is set to star in Disney+'s&nbsp;Boston Strangler, explains that post-Beckham&nbsp;and post-Elizabeth Swann, she felt trapped in the sort of roles she could play.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was the object of everybody’s lust," Knightley says of Swann. "Not that she doesn’t have a lot of fight in her. But it was interesting coming from being really tomboyish to getting projected as quite the opposite. I felt very constrained. I felt very stuck. So, the roles afterward were about trying to break out of that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The roles that came after included blockbuster films like&nbsp;Love Actually, Pride & Prejudice,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Atonement, a period that the actress calls "a very tricky five-year window."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn’t have a sense of how to articulate it," she says of feeling powerless in her own career. "It very much felt like I was caged in a thing I didn’t understand."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knightley cites her drive and desire to be better and better with every role as why she felt like she had to take on certain projects, but she also says it's the reason she felt so burnt out after that five-year run.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was incredibly hard on myself. I was never good enough. I was utterly single-minded. I was so ambitious. I was so driven. I was always trying to get better and better and improve, which is an exhausting way to live your life. Exhausting," she said. "I am in awe of my 22-year-old self, because I’d like a bit more of her back. And it’s only by not being like that any longer that I realize how extraordinary it was. But it does have a cost."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knightley also opened up about being a mother, which she says is just as exhausting as filming a movie.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During filming, the hours are unpredictable and extreme. I worked out I needed three people to do what one full-time parent did. When you hear somebody say, 'I’m just staying home with the kids', that’s not a 'just'. That’s a huge thing," she said. She explained that when someone asks her about balancing mom life with work, she never has an answer. Instead, she insists that people ask because they want to know the secret —&nbsp;and nobody actually knows how to juggle everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What we actually want to know is, 'How are&nbsp;you&nbsp;doing it?' Because I don’t feel like I’m doing it," she said.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yp6gq5ldoLuqs8eto56xXZ2us7zEq6pmmpGvrqK%2BjK6iZqGeqbKzwsiermaln6J6rbXFnmSbmZyWu6SxjK2pmqigmrFuvMirmK2do2K%2FsLjEZm5ra2lpgHM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-briere-bio-age-height-career-wife-children-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Brire Bio, Age, Height, Career, Wife, Children, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./irene-wong.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Irene Wong</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
