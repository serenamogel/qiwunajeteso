A review of a factory desktop machine that isn't some powerhouse gaming beast with liquid cooling, factory overclock and optional sunroof might seem a little unusual here on a site with a readership full of people who like to roll their own. Yet machines like the Studio XPS 7100 have a reason for being and are worthy of any enthusiast's attention.</p><p>For some of us, building a machine can be a lot of fun and very rewarding; for others, it can be an exercise in hair-pulling frustration as parts that “should work” don't. Bad RAM, faulty motherboards, and other potential problems can mar the DIY experience. Other potential users may just be lapsed enthusiasts looking for a decent machine without having to read up on new tech, or enthusiasts that know what parts they want but don't feel inclined to spend the time assembling and tweaking a system. Perhaps you're after a powerful desktop for editing home video, doing photo work, and maybe enjoying an occasional game and you want to keep things as easy as possible.</p><p>The Studio XPS 7100 fills a profoundly useful niche by offering some of the latest technology available on the market in an attractive package. With it, Dell seeks to serve all of the aforementioned users and more.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=575><tbody readability=22.676056338028><tr readability=2><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=2><strong>Dell XPS 7100 Specifications</strong></td></tr><tr readability=7><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>AMD Phenom II X6 1055T<br>(6x2.8GHz, 45nm, 3MB L2, 6MB L3, Turbo Core up to 3.3GHz, 125W)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Chipset</strong></td><td>AMD 785G Northbridge, AMD SB750 Southbridge</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>2x2GB and 2x1GB DDR3-1066 (Total 6GB, Max 4x4GB)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB GDDR5<br>(1600 Stream Processors, 850MHz Core, 4.8GHz Memory, 256-bit memory bus)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Hard Drive(s)</strong></td><td>1.5TB 7200 RPM (Seagate Barracuda 7200.11)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Optical Drive(s)</strong></td><td>Blu-ray reader/DVD+-RW combo drive</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Gigabit Ethernet<br>Dell DW1525 802.11n PCIe wireless</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>Realtek ALC887 HD Audio<br>5.1 audio jacks, mic and line-in</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Front Side</strong></td><td>MMC/SD/CF/MS reader<br>Optical Drive<br>Open 5.25” Bay<br>Open 3.25” Bay<br>2x USB 2.0</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Top</strong></td><td>2x USB 2.0<br>Headphone and mic jack<br>Power button</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Back Side</strong></td><td>AC Power<br>Optical out<br>4x USB 2.0<br>eSATA<br>Gigabit Ethernet jack<br>Surround sound jacks and mic and line-in jacks<br>2x DVI-D<br>HDMI<br>DisplayPort</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>16.02" x 17.9" x 7.31" (WxDxH)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>22.4 lbs</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Extras</strong></td><td>460W Power Supply<br>Wired keyboard and mouse<br>Flash reader (MMC/MS/CF/SD)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Warranty</strong></td><td>1-year basic warranty</td></tr><tr readability=2.1864406779661><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>Starting at <a href=#>$499.99</a><br>Priced as configured: <a href=#>$1,149.99</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Our review unit is Dell's top-end factory configuration for the Studio XPS 7100 line, and a couple of things on the spec sheet immediately jump out. The first is the brand new AMD Phenom II X6 1055T beating at the heart of it, a native six-core, 2.8GHz beast with 6MB of L3 cache and featuring AMD's Turbo Core technology. Turbo Core is a similar but arguably less efficient version of the Turbo Boost feature found in modern Intel Core processors, but it's capable of bumping core speed up to 3.3GHz on the 1055T under the right conditions. Still, even six 2.8GHz Phenom II cores pack enough muscle to get some serious computing done.</p><p>The other eyebrow-raiser in the Studio XPS 7100 is the ATI Radeon HD 5870, ATI's top-of-the-line single-GPU card. Ours is a bone-stock reference version with 1GB of GDDR5. You're undoubtedly familiar with the specs of the 5870, but for the sake of completeness, ATI's monster uses TSMC's 40nm fabrication process and is equipped with 1600 of ATI's stream processors running at a core clock of 850MHz. A 256-bit memory bus is connected to 1GB of GDDR5 running at an effective 4.8GHz. Finally, the card is DirectX 11-class hardware, and is capable of supporting up to three monitors simultaneously or even presenting all three transparently as a single screen in their Eyefinity configuration. While one of these monitors must be connected through DisplayPort (or an active DisplayPort adapter), our review unit was sent to us along with one of Dell's new and remarkably affordable E-IPS panel monitors, and those monitors include native DisplayPort connectivity. (We'll have a separate review of the display in the near future.)</p><p>Rounding out the core of the Studio XPS 7100 is 6GB of DDR3-1333 in the form of a pair of 2GB DIMMs and a pair of 1GB DIMMs. The 6GB is an odd choice; we would have liked to see Dell go whole hog and just include 8GB standard, since in order to make the upgrade later on you'll have to remove the two 1GB sticks. When you order off the site, it may be prudent to save yourself the trouble and pony up the $60 for the upgrade to 8GB.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chipset the memory and processor are plugged into is a bit antiquated these days. The MicroATX board in the guts of the XPS 7100 uses the 785G chipset with the SB750 Southbridge. The 785G's DVI and HDMI ports are actually blocked off by covers on the back of the tower, and a visit to the BIOS yielded no way to enable ATI's SurroundView. That's not a major loss given the three display outputs on the Radeon HD 5870, but the inclusion of the SB750 Southbridge alongside the shiny new Phenom II X6 is disappointing. The more modern SB850 with 6Gbps SATA ports and generally improved SATA performance over its predecessor would have been much appreciated.</p><p>Rounding out the machine are a single 1.5TB Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 hard disk spinning at 7200 RPM with 32MB of cache and a combination Blu-ray reader/DVD burner. Connectivity comes from an onboard Broadcom gigabit Ethernet port and Dell's own 1525 model PCIe wireless-n card. The wireless card is awesomely adorable, fitting into the PCIe x1 slot without extending at all beyond it and keeping a low profile, and it sits in the slot just above the Radeon HD 5870. Finally, audio duties are handled by a Realtek ALC887 HD audio controller.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB4hZdom56knGLAtcHDoqZmsKCoenh9j2k%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./narutos-ren-most-surprising-characters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Narutos Ren Most Surprising Characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elgin-baylor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elgin Baylor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
