We’re talking Hadids! Jenners! Kardashians! And it all begins with David Foster.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>David who?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">David Foster, the Grammy winning producer and artist, is at the epicenter of one of the most elaborate Hollywood family trees known to Wikipedia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s take a step back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an Instagram post commemorating their one-year anniversary, Hudson revealed that Fujikawa is the stepbrother of Foster's daughters, Erin and Sara, whom she refers to as her best friends. Hudson notes that she first met Fujikawa through the sisters 15 years ago during her pregnancy with her first child with ex Chris Robinson. (The details of the Fosters' and Fujikawa's step-sibling relationship—specifically, which of Fujikawa’s parents was married to which of the Foster sisters’ parents—has not been publicly discussed.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And through their father's relationships, the Foster sisters are tangentially related to a whole slew of famouses—so many, in fact, that their fringe Hollywood relations were the premise of their VH1 faux-reality drama, <i>Barely Famous</i>. For the record, both Erin and Sara themselves are famous actresses and former models in their own right, and are often spotted on the Hollywood/fashion party circuit. If you’re wondering why Sara’s name feels so familiar, it may be because she was recently made the news as a person who definitely did not bite Beyonce.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>First comes the Fosters, then the Hadids.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From 2011 to 2017, David was married to Yolanda Hadid, matriarch of the Hadid modeling empire comprised of Gigi, Bella and Anwar, Yolanda’s children from her previous marriage to real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid. Thus, Erin and Sara are the ex-stepsiblings of some of the most powerful supermodels on Earth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>But wait, you said something about the Jenners.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes! Let’s not forget our pals the Jenners. Though the linkage gets a bit weaker from here, we’ll go with it anyway. From 1991 to 2005, Foster was married to songwriter Linda Thompson. You've probably never heard of Thompson, but you’ve definitely heard of her ex-husband, Olympic gold-medalist Bruce Jenner, now Caitlyn Jenner, as well as the couple’s sons and <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> guest stars, Brody and Brandon Jenner. Ironically, long before the Kardashians became the pop culture obsession du jour, ladies were fangirling over Brody on <i>Laguna Beach</i>. Oh how the tides have turned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So that means the Kardashians are in the mix too?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t get us wrong, we know it’s a stretch. But following the web of relationships, yes, Fujikawa is separated by 5 degrees of marriage to the Kardashian clan, given Caitlyn Jenner’s since-dissolved marriage to Kris Jenner. If this sounds a bit confusing, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> made a handy visual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Can we include Kanye in this or…?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure! At this point, why not? While we’re at it, might as well include Scott Disick, Tristan Thompson and Travis Scott, who are fathers of children of the Kardashian/Jenners, and thus forever linked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>So Hudson's baby will be like, the most well-connected child in Hollywood.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that we’re thoroughly up to date on the Foster/Fujikawa associations, we can focus on Hudson, who herself is a product of an illustrious Hollywood dynasty. The 39-year-old’s most well-known connection is her Oscar-winning mama Goldie Hawn, who is married to another Hollywood A-lister, Kurt Russell. Hudson's biological father is Bill Hudson, a musician and actor who is best known being her Kate Hudson's Dad (although Wikipedia will argue he’s best-known The Hudson Brothers band.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson and Fujikawa’s little girl will join Hudson’s two boys, 14-year-old Ryder Robinson from her relationship with The Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and 6-year-old Bingham Bellamy, from her relationship with Matt Bellamy of the band Muse. So yes, she will also be related to rock royalty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Talk </a>back in December, Hudson said of relationship with Fujikawa, “we kinda skipped through the part of knowing what the hiccups were...you kinda skip the part of going, 'Oh, you're like that?'... I've known his family forever... to have that connection is really powerful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The more you know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeblsGmeceum6ynnmKxorrNsmSfrZqeuKLDwGafmpyZmXqrsc2nnKtlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-jones-quincy-jones-daughter-carol-raynolds.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Rachel Jones Photos Of Quincy Jones Daughter With Carol Raynolds</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./soothsayer-nyt-crossword.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Soothsayer Crossword Clue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
