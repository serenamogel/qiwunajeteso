They believe that these people are "anointed" by God to become part of the spiritual "Israel of God".<h2>What's the difference between Christianity and Jehovah's Witness?</h2>Religious beliefs and practices<p>Jehovah's Witnesses identify as Christians, but their beliefs are different from other Christians in some ways. For instance, they teach that Jesus is the son of God but is not part of a Trinity.</p><h2>Why do Jehovah Witnesses not celebrate Christmas?</h2>Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas or Easter because they believe that these festivals are based on (or massively contaminated by) pagan customs and religions.

Our faith in Jesus Christ can be strengthened as we come to recognize His unchanging nature and His everlasting gospel.<h2>What makes Jehovah Witnesses different from other religions?</h2>Instead they believe that parts of the Bible are written in "figurative or symbolic language."
