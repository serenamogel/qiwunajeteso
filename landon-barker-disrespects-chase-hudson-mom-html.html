You clearly wanted to be Chase so badly that you started dating his ex-es and doing things he did by being in the studio,” wrote the fan.&nbsp;</p><p>They accused Landon of taking Chase’s loved ones away.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Landon Barker Disrespects Chase Hudson’s Mom</h2><p>The tweet received a like from Hudson's mom, and it seems this did not sit well with Landon&nbsp;because, in the next tweet, he called out mama Hudson.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Landon Barker disrespects Chase Hudson's mom, Tamora Hudson.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Tamora, you gotta chill, you pushing 70,"&nbsp;tweeted Landon, which has since been deleted but screengrabbed and reshared by social media tea pages.&nbsp;</p><p>In The original Tiktokroom post, netizens called out Landon and said he was being disrespectful.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Yeah, ultimately this is going to backfire. he was trying to be funny, but that’s just disrespectful.,” wrote one user.&nbsp;Another user wrote, “that’s mad disrespectful! and he thinks he’s in the right, bruh.”</p><p>“Notice how he posted and then deleted yet again. say the disrespectful [expletive] with ur chest, Landon babe,” a third one chimed in.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Tamora has not responded to Landon’s tweet, but she did like fans’ tweets that called out Landon’s rude behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Chase, since he released his song, he has laid low and refrained from commenting on anything on social media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSRo7GwuoybmKujlad6pbXSq5ysqJWYwbR5wqGYrJ1dncKlv86nZKannWO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./our-song-2001.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Our Song movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2001)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-doordash-give-w2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does DoorDash give w2?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
