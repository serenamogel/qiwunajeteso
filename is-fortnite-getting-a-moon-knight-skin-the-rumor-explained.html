Epic Games houses Fortnite under its umbrella, and it was shared that Epic Games & Disney recently asked creators to be part of a premiere event for the upcoming Disney Plus series, Moon Knight.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>It‚Äôs noted that the last time this happened was with Dune, and soon after the event, the Dune collaboration went live within the game. Another famous player in the Fortnite realm, Shiina, shared this Tweet that fans were excited about just days ago.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Moon Knight collab coming soon? üò≥</p><p>Epic Games & Disney invited some Fortnite content creators to a premiere event for the upcoming Moon Knight show!</p><p>The same happened with Dune, a collab took place shortly after.. üëÄ</p><p>(Thanks to <a href=#>@NotPaloleaks</a> for making me aware of this!) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IIynojsQ2u</a></p>‚Äî Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href=#>March 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Several other gamers have shared the news, crediting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NotPalo</a> for first releasing the information.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>As spotted by <a href=#>@NotPaloleaks</a>;</p><p>Epic Games appears to have invited some content creators to watch the premiere of Moon Knight.

It‚Äôs important to note that none of the rumors are confirmed, but they are definitely on the radar of those who play Fortnite often.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fortnite collaborates with almost every major release nowadays, so it's a no brainer that a majority of these titles below will receive cosmetics <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iXGOfAoxLd</a></p>‚Äî Justin (@Justin_Neagle) <a href=#>March 16, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>As fans of Moon Knight know, the character has several aliases, which are later learned to be personalities as he is diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. Without giving too much away, if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the character of Moon Knight, it wasn‚Äôt until later issues that his aliases became personalities. CBR recently did an informative deep dive on the character, which shows more about the road to the Moon Knight we will meet in the Disney Plus series.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>A skin with the character would be multifaceted.

There are several. From Star-Lord and Black Widow to Deadpool and Iron Man, those who have been playing the game for several chapters and seasons have likely collected many of them. If you‚Äôve not been involved with the game since the beginning, there are still opportunities to look out for skins that may return to the game and the opportunities to purchase any skins from future Marvel projects.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>While the Moon Knight rumor is still a rumor at this point, it‚Äôs exciting to indulge the idea that we could see Moon Knight in the game soon.
