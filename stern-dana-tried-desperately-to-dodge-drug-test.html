Obviously, we don’t have to test it now,” Stern said.</p><p>“We had a lot of deception going on, I think.”</p><p>Authorities believe Plato’s death in Oklahoma was accidental, although a probe was continuing.</p><p>Stern’s bombshell came as several callers – and the mother of Todd Bridges, Plato’s TV co-star – blamed Stern for possibly driving her over the edge.</p><p>“After going on his show maybe she thought, ‘I need to take a Valium to calm me down because people think I’m on drugs,'” Betty Bridges told The Post.</p><p>“If you’re not taking drugs and they’re saying you are, then you’re tripping out. She’s very sensitive.”</p><p>Bridges suggested Plato turned to drugs after her mom, Kay, died in the 1980s of a blood disease that resulted in the amputation of her arms and legs.</p><p>Stern said he didn’t feel any blame, insisting Plato seemed to be enjoying herself on his show.</p><p>“Maybe we gave her her last good time. She thanked me afterward. She was sweet, very nice,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Todd Bridges told TV’s “Inside Edition,” “I thought something was wrong … I was hoping I was wrong … You could see it on Dana’s face that she was hurting and she needed a lot of help.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Fuhnp7j25mamlfqMGmvs1mm5qmkWLBs7XEnWSdnaOlsrOt056jsmWkpHqlu8OgnGacoqq0bsDErKto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mara-derwent-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mara Derwent Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Casper Smart Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
