I’d get very upset and tell them, 'You have to believe me! She’s my sister!'</p><p>She explained that a lot of people could not wrap their heads around the idea of a multiracial family because of the way that they were raised to think.</p><p>A part of the blame was also put on the media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Because people didn't see as many multiracial families in the media, they would often see such a family as radical or strange.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She did go on to say that the trend was changing for the better in recent times, though.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She claimed that she had been&nbsp;seeing a lot more mixed kids like herself in recent times.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmdlruluMBmqq2dnpeys7OMqZirnZ6pwG%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thirsty-wakanda-forever-enthusiasts-outraged-that-namors-trident-was-downsized-by-vfx-team.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Namors crotch originally had a much bigger part to play in Wakanda Forever</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./preeti-kumari-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-603938-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Preeti Kumari Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
