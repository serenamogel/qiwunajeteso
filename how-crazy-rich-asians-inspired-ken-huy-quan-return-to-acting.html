They’ve said his example helped inspire them to pursue careers in Hollywood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Quan, 51, says he’s the one who should be thanking them. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities for Asian performers, Quan abandoned acting more than two decades ago. He was lured back due to positive changes in Asian representation in movies and television in recent years, especially in the 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“They always thank me and say, ‘Man, it was so great to see you up there on the screen, because I was able to see myself.

My return to acting is the direct result of the progress made by them.
