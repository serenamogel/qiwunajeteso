The death of Mary’s father, which occurred just days after her birth, put her on the throne as an infant. She briefly became queen consort in France before returning to Scotland. Forced to abdicate by Scottish nobles in 1567, Mary sought the protection of England's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-elizabeth-i data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Elizabeth I" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, who instead had her arrested. Mary spent the remainder of her life in captivity until her 1587 execution.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary Stuart was born on December 8, 1542, in Linlithgow Palace, West Lothian, Scotland. Mary’s father died when she was only six days old, making her queen of Scotland.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary was the daughter of King James V of Scotland and his second wife, Mary of Guise. Mary’s great-grandfather was Henry VII, making <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/henry-viii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry VIII" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Henry VIII</a> her great uncle. Elizabeth I was Mary's cousin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Given that Mary was only an infant, her great-uncle Henry VIII made a bid for control. Her mother, however, ended up acting as regent on Mary's behalf.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary was initially betrothed to Henry VIII's son, Prince Edward of England, who eventually became King Edward VI. Scottish Catholics, however, objected to this plan, since England had separated from the Catholic Church. When the match was annulled, England attacked Scotland in raids that became known as "The Rough Wooing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the age of 5, Mary was sent to France, where she grew up in the luxurious French court. Mary's mother was French, and the Scots had a longstanding alliance with France, so Mary was betrothed to the 4-year-old French heir.</p><img alt="Queen Elizabeth & Mary Queen of Scots" title="Queen Elizabeth & Mary Queen of Scots" width=1800 height=1013 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-i_mary-queen-of-scots.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photos: DeAgostini/Getty Images; National Galleries Of Scotland/Getty Images</span><p>A portrait of Queen Elizabeth I (left) with Mary, Queen of Scots.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Spouses</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary was married three times, with the last union eventually leading to her downfall.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Francis II, King of France</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1558, Mary married Francis, the eldest son of French King Henry II and Catherine de Medicis. In 1559, Mary's husband was crowned Francis II, making Mary both the queen of Scotland and France's queen consort. Unfortunately, Francis died from an ear infection the year after he ascended to the throne, leaving Mary a widow at age 18.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Henry Stewart, Earl of Darnley</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1565 Mary gave into infatuation and married her cousin, Henry Stewart, Earl of Darnley. Mary's new husband was a grandson of Margaret Tudor; Mary uniting with a Tudor infuriated Elizabeth Tudor. Her marriage to Darnley also turned Mary's half-brother against her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after their marriage, Darnley’s ruthless ambition caused problems. In 1566 Darnley and a group of Protestant nobles viciously murdered David Rizzio, Mary's Italian secretary, stabbing him 56 times as a pregnant Mary looked on. Though she gave birth to their son a few months later, she no longer wished to be married to Darnley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Darnley was mysteriously killed following an explosion at Kirk o' Field, outside Edinburgh, in February 1567, foul play was suspected. Mary's involvement is unclear.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In May 1567 Mary consented to marry James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell — the main suspect in her previous husband Darnley’s murder. Over the years, Bothwell had become a close confidant of Mary and was said to exert great influence over her. He also had his own ambitions to become king, and he had abducted Mary and held her captive in Dunbar Castle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary’s scandalous marriage with Bothwell, just three months after Darnley’s murder, made the Scottish nobility rise against her. Bothwell went into exile, where he was ultimately arrested and held captive until his death. Meanwhile, in July 1567, Mary was compelled to abdicate the throne in Scotland in favor of her infant son. She was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY2Njc4OTc0NTkwNjI1MTIw/maryqueenofscots_facts_desktop.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS FACT CARD" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS FACT CARD</a></strong></p><img alt="Mary, Queen of Scots Fact Card" title="Mary, Queen of Scots Fact Card" width=600 height=1519 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/maryqueenofscots_facts_desktop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On June 19, 1566, Mary gave birth to the future James VI of Scotland and James I of England.

By that time, John Knox's influence had changed Scotland's official religion from Catholicism to Protestantism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a Roman Catholic raised in France, Mary found herself an outsider. However, with help from her illegitimate half-brother, James, Earl of Moray, Mary managed to rule while creating an atmosphere of religious tolerance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the mysterious death of Mary's second husband, Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, and her quick marriage to Bothwell, the Scottish nobility rose up against her and compelled her to hand over rule to her son and imprisoned her.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Claim to the English Throne and Imprisonment by Elizabeth I</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the great-granddaughter of King Henry VII, Mary had a strong claim to the English throne. Her French father-in-law, Henry II, made this claim on her behalf. However Mary never became the queen of England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In November 1558, Henry VIII's daughter, Elizabeth Tudor, became Queen Elizabeth I of England following the death of her sister, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/mary-tudor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Tudor" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Mary Tudor</a>. Many Roman Catholics did not recognize the validity of Henry VIII's marriage to Elizabeth's mother, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/anne-boleyn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anne Boleyn" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Anne Boleyn</a>, and they considered Elizabeth's rule to be illegitimate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1568, Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle, where she was imprisoned by the Scottish nobility for her unseemly marriage with Bothwell. She raised an army but was soon defeated. She fled to England, where she sought Elizabeth's protection. Instead of helping her cousin, the queen imprisoned Mary. Mary's captivity would last for the next 18 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, English Catholics plotted to get Mary, a Catholic herself, onto the throne by assassinating Elizabeth. Mary corresponded with one such plotter, Anthony Babington.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Elizabeth's spymaster uncovered the letters in 1586, Mary was brought to trial. She was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death.</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="css-5xada3 emevuu60">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Elizabeth signed her cousin's death warrant for treason, Mary was executed in Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, on February 8, 1587. She was 44 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elizabeth had Mary buried in Peterborough Cathedral.
