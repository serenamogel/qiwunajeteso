It depends on who you ask. Some folks like their gummies to be soft and tender, others think the best gummy candies are tough and chewy (I fall into that camp). Some want sour gummy candy, others want it to taste like pure fruit. And then there are the vegans who need their gummy candies to be gelatin-free. As long as you think gummy is yummy, then we found the best gummy candy for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In our initial taste test, conducted way back in 2022, we were simply looking for the best gummy candy in the most traditional sense. We looked for gummies that weren’t too soft, vibrantly flavorful, and molded into fun shapes. The top ranked gummies from that taste test are still on this list, but in our most recent gummy candy taste test we looked for some niche entries. We tasted plant-based gummy candy, low sugar gummy candy, and we searched for the best peach rings (which we found) as well as the best gummy sharks (which we did not find). We also included the best sour gummy candy from our <a href=#>best sour candy ranking</a>.</p><p>What we ended up with is a much more complete list of the best gummy candies, which, I think, includes something for everyone. That said, our search for the best gummy candy is never truly over. If you think we left out a category or you have a favorite gummy we simply must try, please leave us a note in the comments. We read them—seriously. Here’s the best gummy candy you can buy.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Smart Sweets Cola Gummies" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking-update_gummy-candy_inset-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Low Carb</strong></p><strong>Smart Sweets Cola Gummies</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walgreens</a><p>If you’re looking for the best keto gummies that truly fit into the keto lifestyle, you’re not going to find them here. But these low carb, low sugar gummies will work if you’re not a super strict keto keeper. With just 3g sugar and 100 calories (plus 13g fiber) per each 50g bag, these aren’t quite “healthy” but you can chow down on an entire bag without scarfing down your entire week’s worth of sugar. That said, these are definitely not a dupe for other candies on this list. If you’re really craving sweet, sweet gummy candy, this isn’t going to scratch that itch. But if you’re more interested in a textural experience (these are very firm, very sticky-chewy gummies), then these will satisfy—I finished off a bag in traffic. Out of all the Smart Sweets flavors I tried, these taste the most like actual candy. They taste like a memory of Haribo Happy-Cola—herbal, sweet, faintly root beer-y. If you’ve been curious about Smart Sweets, this is the best low sugar gummies from that brand that we tried. &nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walgreens</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="eFrutti Gummi Pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking-update_gummy-candy_inset-16.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Interactive</p><strong>eFrutti Gummi Pizza</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>It may not win on flavor alone, but this product is too cute and too fun to pass up. You still get the translucent gummy satisfaction in the form of the toppings, but everything is undercut by a vanilla-tinged, opaque “crust,” which is verging on taffy. It’s hard to discern what kinds of toppings the little multi-colored gummies on the pizza are supposed to represent—but that’s fun, too. It’s nice to maintain a little mystery in life. Plus, the pizza is cut into five slices so you can actually eat it like a tiny pizza. Adorable. If you’re looking for the best gummy candy based on aesthetics alone, this is the choice for you.</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Favorite Day Peach Rings Gummi Candies" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking-update_gummy-candy_inset-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Peach Rings</strong></p><strong>Favorite Day Peach Rings Gummi Candies</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Before you yell at me, Haribo Peaches are not peach rings. So, I could not consider them in the title for the best peach rings. I could have sworn they made peach rings, but they don’t. Must be a Mandela effect. Anyway, out of the peach rings I did try, Target came out on top with the store’s Favorite Day Peach Rings. They’re sweet and actually peachy. They have a nice chew but aren’t too firm. They’re what you think of when you think of peach rings. After tasting a few different brands, I can honestly tell you not all peach rings taste the same, and these are the best peach rings out there.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Katjes Plant-Based Gummies Rainbow Gummy Candy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking-update_gummy-candy_inset-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Vegan(ish) Gummy</strong></p><strong>Katjes Plant-Based Gummies Rainbow Gummy Candy</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walgreens</a><p>There’s no animal gelatin in these plant-based gummies. But they still have that classic, gummy candy texture, which is pretty impressive. I’m not going to pretend these are wholesome and homemade—they still include things like dextrose and carnauba wax—but they’re colored with plant- and algae-derived colors. And those colors are gorgeous—the unicorn heads and rainbows have a vibrant rainbow ombre effect. And the flavor is good, too! It’s a lot like Welch’s fruit snacks—really, really fruity but with a gummy candy texture. Note: I say these are vegan “ish” because they are made on equipment that processes products made with milk, so there might be trace amounts of dairy. We’re still on the hunt for the best vegan gummies that are truly vegan, but these come close.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walgreens</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Haribo Alphabet Letters" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking-update_gummy-candy_inset-15.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Shapes</p><strong>Haribo Alphabet Letters</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>These gummies and I have been through a lot together.

They have the perfect amount of resistance, all of those classically delicious flavors, and a bevy of shapes for you to enjoy. Greg wasn’t sold. “I don’t want to spell a word,” he said. I get it. He doesn’t want to work while he’s enjoying a gummy. But isn’t it fun that you could spell a word with your sweet treat if you wanted to?

You have the stems to nibble at, as well as the round, pillowy cherries—they’re big enough so you can take bits and bites if you want, but not so big that you can’t take one down in one go.

They have a nice firm bite and good flavor saturation. Plus, they come in some unexpected flavors like mango and pink grapefruit along with classic hits like blue raspberry, green apple, and cherry.

And upon trying them again during our taste test, I was struck once more by their genius. We tried other gummy candy adaptations, such as Skittles and Starburst, but these were the only ones that really got it right. They have that perfectly satisfying squish, that same zesty tang of the classic hard candy, and, as Greg put it, “the fun factor.” You can put the rings on your fingers and eat them off.

The flavors are bold and tropical—and very much different from your classic gummy worms. The texture is dense—in a good way. Make sure to warm up your jaw before you dive into a bag of these.
