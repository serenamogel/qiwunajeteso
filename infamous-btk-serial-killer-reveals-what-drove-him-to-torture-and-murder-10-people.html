BTK task force investigator, said when the book was released.</p><p>Police said they suppressed most of the details of the planned murder for 11 years because they feared what the shock of a public revelation might do to the woman.</p><p>But authorities did inform the woman after finding out that defense attorneys for Rader had hired investigators who might contact her.</p><p>"She's a pretty tough lady, but this shook her up quite a bit," Relph said.</p><p>Following his arrest, several of the victims' relatives sued Rader and secured a settlement that agreed he could never profit from his
