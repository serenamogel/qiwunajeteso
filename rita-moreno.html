Moreno also appeared on the children's shows Sesame Street and The Electric Company and is one of only 11 people to have received the four major entertainment honors — Emmy, Oscar, Tony and Grammy awards (EGOT). In 2019, she added another letter to her list of accolades when she became the first Latino honored with a Peabody Award, making her a PEGOT.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Rosa Dolores Alverio<br>BORN: December 11, 1931<br>BIRTHPLACE: Humacao, Puerto Rico<br>SPOUSE: Leonard Gordon (m. 1965-2010)</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Rosa Dolores Alverio on December 11, 1931, in Humacao, Puerto Rico, Moreno has broken new ground for Latinos in the field of entertainment throughout her career. Moreno began her career in show business at early age. She appeared on Broadway and in her first film role in her early teens, and left school around the same time.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="'West Side Story' Success" data-anchor-id=west-side-story-success class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'West Side Story' Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moreno is perhaps best known for her work in West Side Story (1961), a modern musical inspired by Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. A versatile performer, she had to sing, dance and handle very dramatic scenes during the course of the film. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Anita, the tough but vulnerable girlfriend to the Sharks's gang leader — becoming the first Hispanic actress to win a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Other Achievements and EGOT Status" data-anchor-id=other-achievements-and-egot-status class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Other Achievements and EGOT Status</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her success with West Side Story, Moreno took on a range of interesting roles on stage and in films.

Her career took another interesting turn in the 1970s, when joined the cast of The Electric Company, a children's television program. She stayed with the program for six seasons and became known for her trademark catchphrase: "Hey, you guys." She and the rest of the cast won a Grammy Award in 1972 for the show's soundtrack.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Only a few years later, Moreno won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her work in Broadway's The Ritz (1975).
