Remember him with these facts about his life, family, daughter, and charitable work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Paul Walker's sudden death was shocking for multiple reasons: the actor who was most famous for starring in a franchise that's all about driving fast cars died in a horrible crash. He was also only 40 years old when tragedy struck, and the accident occurred during filming for Fast 7.</p><p>I and a lot of my friends grew up watching Paul Walker in the Fast & Furious films. We watched them go from pretty cool, to downright awful, to pretty cool again, and then to over-the-top action fests that made summer great.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he was a recurring, major character in the one of Hollywood's biggest-grossing, long-standing franchises, Paul Walker's real life is somehow more interesting and awesome than all of the Fast movies combined.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. His mom was a model.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: entertainment tonight</span></figure><p>Cheryl Walker, not to be confused <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with this late actress</a> who shared the screen with Katherine Hepburn, is partly responsible for Paul Walker's dashing good looks. She was a fashion model, after all. Cheryl was also with Paul moments before he passed. In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she recalled the text message he received</a>: he'd forgotten about a fundraiser he was supposed to attend and was out the door.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. He comes from a boxing family.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: boxrec</a></figure><p>Paul Walker III, the actor's father, was a legit boxer who followed in the footsteps of his own father, "Irish Billie Walker", who was also a professional pugilist. Walker's dad even played a boxing coach in one of his son's earlier films, The Skulls.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. He was a BJJ Brown Belt.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: openmat</a></figure><p>Paul was an avid brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner, and was only one step away from a black belt before he died. The path to earning a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is notoriously difficult and drawn-out. Walker also trained in Muay Thai kickboxing. In some Fast scenes, like the prison breakout in part 6, you could see him using a traditional clinch while fighting a random bad guy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. He was a bonafide car fanatic.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: universal pictures</span></figure><p>Thanks to the Fast & Furious movies you had tons of wannabe tuners slapping ginormous spoilers and whack decals onto their 1992 automatic Toyota Corrollas. But Paw Waw would've never done that, because was a legitimate car junkie. In fact, the Skyline that was featured in Fast & Furious was actually his, and he consulted with the production team on all the tuner cars and whips that should be in the films. Talk about injecting your passions into your profession.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. He loved racing.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Paul was part of the AE Performance racing team: his car of choice was a tricked out BMW M3 E92. In the photo above, he's pictured with friend and teammate Roger Rodas, who also perished in the car crash with the late actor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Pablo.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Vin Diesel constantly referred to Paul as his "brother" and even had an affectionate nickname for him: Pablo. Vin, along with the film's other co-stars, were devastated after Paul's death. He named his daughter Pauline in honor of his late friend.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. He was a big humanitarian.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>Although he rarely publicized his charitable acts, Paul was a notoriously giving soul. He founded "Reach Out Worldwide" with his own money after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and traveled there to assist with the efforts. He then launched the nonprofit, which continues to help those in need.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. He was obsessed with marine life.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: discovery channel</span></figure><p>Paul attended several colleges in the SoCal area where he majored in marine biology. But that's not all: he legitimately swam with sharks for National Geographic's Expedition Great White. He spent 11 days with the crew and assisted in capturing and tagging seven sharks in Mexico. The week before he died, he even filmed a Shark Week special, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spawn of Jaws: The Birth</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. He loved, loved, loved surfing.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: buena vista pictures</span></figure><p>Walker was very vocal about his love of surfing, which makes sense given his passion for the ocean and marine life. "The surfing reassures me. It has always been a sort of zen experience for me. The ocean is so magnificent, quiet and impressive. The rest of the world disappears for me when I am in a wave."</p><p>It also makes sense that his house was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> pretty much right on the beach.</a> Many days he'd wake up, grab his board, and just go.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. His first gig was a Pampers commercial.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: gsmbiring | youtube</a></figure><p>Paul Walker was a baby model and landed his first big gig at 2 years old. Not a bad start for the California native. Much later in his career, he was in the running for other big roles, like Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four and Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars Episodes II and III. He was ultimately ruled out for being "too old" and the part was given to Hayden Christiansen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. His brothers stepped up after his crash.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: universal pictures</span></figure><p>After Paul's tragic accident, some of his scenes for Fast 7 needed to be completed. His brothers, Cody and Caleb, acted as body doubles. Their footage, combined with old cuts from Fast 5 that weren't previously used, were spliced together for the memorable "See you Again" scene at the end of the film.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. He surprised a young engaged couple.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>While in a jewelry store, Paul noticed a military vet shopping for rings with his fiancée. Walker then approached the store's manager and let them know that whatever ring they picked out, he would pay for it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. He wanted to be closer to his daughter.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>Paul's daughter, Meadow, lived with her mother in Hawaii for 13 years. But in 2011, she moved to California to live her papa. Before he died, Paul was planning on quitting acting to spend more time with his daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. He didn't like watching himself.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Paul never rewatched his movies after attending the premieres. Probably because he was too busy surfing, saving sharks, racing his cars, and being a humanitarian.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. His co-stars visited the site of his crash.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: people video grab</a></figure><p>You can see the impact Paul had on his close friends and co-stars' faces after they visited the site where his tragic crash occurred. Tyrese Gibson was visibly upset, and even kept a piece of the wreckage in remembrance of Paul.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqaV9nhHCexG2sbYRjZL2iwctmrpqkm5q%2FbrDArp6hrJWneqO%2Bzq2fnqqjYrGmrdOh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bojack-horseman-season-2-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BoJack Horseman Season 2 Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-tall-is-carley-shimkus.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How tall is Carley Shimkus</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
