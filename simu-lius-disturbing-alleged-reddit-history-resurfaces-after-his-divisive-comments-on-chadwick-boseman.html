On the account were a number of concerning comments and more than a few identifying features such as screenshots with Liu’s name next to the account as well as comments in which u/nippedinthebud referred to themselves as Simu Liu.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Although Liu has not substantiated the allegations that he was the owner of the account, or that he made any racist, misogynistic, or homophobic comments, Marvel fans remain convinced and have held him liable for the remarks. One such remark was a post in which u/nippedinthebud identified themselves as a Canadian actor, which Liu is, and expressed sympathy for pedophilias due to research they did for a character they were playing on a show.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the end the role completely changed the way I look at pedophilia and has made me much more sympathetic to anyone who is born with those urges.
