It continues 20 years later, with Clark more-or-less happily teaching in a good school in a nice neighborhood.</p><p>Then we get an updated look at Eastside High, which has become the town's deeply troubled, mostly minority high school, where violence, drug-dealing and intimidation are facts of life, and little or no learning takes place. <a href=#>John Avildsen</a>, the director, is so concerned with showing us the hell of Eastside High that he goes overboard; the corridors look like a cross between a prison riot and a Hells' Angel rally.</p><p>There obviously is only one man capable of turning this situation around, and so "Crazy" Joe Clark is brought back to Eastside.</p><p>His first act is to call an all-school assembly, gather all the druggies and troublemakers onstage, and expel them en masse. Then he begins to stalk the school corridors, enforcing his own reign of terror. He orders all of the graffiti painted over. Fine. He orders everyone to learn the school song, on pain of expulsion. Sort of fine.</p><p>He suspends a teacher for daring to stoop over and pick up a piece of scrap paper while Clark was talking. Not fine. He insults teachers in front of students, behaves in an erratic and irrational way, and conducts himself like an autocratic dictator. Bad.</p><p>This is a seriously troubled man. As the movie progresses, we wait for Clark to undergo a personality change, to soften, to grow, to start learning to respect the right of other people to have an opinion. But with the exception of one halfhearted apology, Clark never does change.</p><p>He is an arrogant bully, a martinet who demands instant, unquestioning obedience.</p><p>Yes, he does clean up Eastside High. And, yes, the students are able to pass a state proficiency exam, so the school can remain under local control and not be taken over by the state. But we never see how this is done. "<a href=#>Stand and Deliver</a>," last year's film about a dedicated Hispanic math teacher, was about a teaching and learning process. "Lean on Me" is about a disciplinary process. The movie's most bizarre scene has Clark onstage at a pre-exam pep rally, ranting and raving and leading the school song, as if the test were a football game. But you can't pass a test simply because your spirits are high. And I am not convinced that any kind of meaningful learning can take place under Clark's reign of public humiliation. Discipline is not the same thing as intimidation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lnJqmXaS7brnEZmhycGk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oliver-heldens-releases-ooh-la-la-hilo-alias.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oliver Heldens Releases Ooh La La Under HI-LO Alias</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./holly-hunter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Holly Hunter Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bastian-schweinsteiger.html>Bastian Schweinsteiger- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Weight, Height, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-romer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-675086-html.html>Alex Romer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-seasons-1-5-of-billions-on-netflix-4846-html.html>Are Seasons 1-5 of Billions on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jasper-p-c3-a4-c3-a4kk-c3-b6nen.html>Jasper Pkknen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./casper-smart-net-worth-133804.html>Casper Smart Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
